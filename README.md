# jooQ Examples
This repository contains code examples for the Java `jooQ` library, which provides object oriented access to a SQL database.

The code contained in this repo is mostly a thinly modified version of snippets found at [the jooQ website](https://www.jooq.org).

The database used for these examples was obtained from https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db. This database is currently hosted on an AWS instance, which is what the examples connect to. There is a strong likelihood that this server will not be running indefinitely, so these examples will need a suitable URL substitution in order to run (e.g. `localhost` for a local MySql server).
